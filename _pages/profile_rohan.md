Rohan Sinha is a PhD candidate in Aeronautics and Astronautics. His research focuses on developing methodologies that improve the reliability of ML-enabled robotic systems, particularly when these systems encounter out-of-distribution conditions with respect to their training data. Broadly, his research interests lie at the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and applied robotics.
As an undergraduate, Rohan worked on data-driven predictive control under [Prof. Francesco Borrelli](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/francesco-borrelli/) in the [Model Predictive Control Lab](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/mpc-lab/home) and on learning control algorithms that rely on vision systems under [Prof. Benjamin Recht](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/) in the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Lab. He has also interned as an autonomous driving engineer at Delphi (now [Motional](https://motional.com/)) and as a software engineer at Amazon. Rohan is co-advised by Prof. Sanjay Lall and [Prof. Marco Pavone](https://web.stanford.edu/~pavone/), who runs the [Stanford Autonomous Systems Lab](https://stanfordasl.github.io/).
